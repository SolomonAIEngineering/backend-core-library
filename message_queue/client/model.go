// The SendRequest type represents a message to be sent to a queue with a specified URL, body, and

// @property {string} QueueURL - QueueURL is a string property that represents the URL of the Amazon
// SQS queue to which the message will be sent.
// @property {string} Body - The message body that will be sent to the specified queue.
// @property {[]Attribute} Attributes - Attributes is a slice of Attribute structs that can be used to
// add custom metadata to the message being sent to the queue. These attributes can be used to provide
// additional information about the message, such as message type, priority, or any other relevant
// information. The Attribute struct typically contains a Name and a Value

// @property {string} Body - The message body, which contains the content of the message being sent or
// received.
// @property Attributes - Attributes is a map of key-value pairs that provide additional information
// about the message. These attributes can include metadata such as message timestamps, message
// grouping IDs, and message deduplication IDs. The specific attributes available depend on the
// messaging service being used.
