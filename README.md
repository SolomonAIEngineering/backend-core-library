Core-Library is the core [Go](https://golang.org/) library of [simfiny](https://www.simfiny.app/login/).
It provides a set ofpackaeges to directly measure performance and behavior of your software and send this data to observability platforms.

### Compatibility

simfiny-core-lib ensures compatibility with the current supported versions of
the [Go language](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release#policy):

> Each major Go release is supported until there are two newer major releases.
> For example, Go 1.5 was supported until the Go 1.7 release, and Go 1.6 was supported until the Go 1.8 release.

For versions of Go that are no longer supported upstream, simfiny-core-lib will
stop ensuring compatibility with these versions in the following manner:

- A minor release of simfiny-core-lib will be made to add support for the new
  supported release of Go.
- The following minor release of simfiny-core-lib will remove compatibility
  testing for the oldest (now archived upstream) version of Go. This, and
  future, releases of simfiny-core-lib may include features only supported by
  the currently supported versions of Go.

Currently, this project supports the following environments.

| OS      | Go Version | Architecture |
| ------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Ubuntu  | 1.20       | amd64        |
| Ubuntu  | 1.19       | amd64        |
| Ubuntu  | 1.20       | 386          |
| Ubuntu  | 1.19       | 386          |
| MacOS   | 1.20       | amd64        |
| MacOS   | 1.19       | amd64        |
| Windows | 1.20       | amd64        |
| Windows | 1.19       | amd64        |
| Windows | 1.20       | 386          |
| Windows | 1.19       | 386          |

While this project should work for other systems, no compatibility guarantees
are made for those systems currently.
